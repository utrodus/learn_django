## Summary of What I Learned in Chapter 03: Django From Beginner by William Vincent

In Chapter 03, I learned how to create views using Django Class-Based Views (CBVs), which provide a more modular and reusable way to handle HTTP requests. I created views with CBVs by extending Django's generic views and linked them to URLs in `urls.py`. 

Additionally, I explored creating reusable templates using template inheritance, allowing me to define a base template and extend it in other templates to maintain consistent layouts. Also i'm using [pico.css](https://picocss.com/) for basic css styling. Finally, I learned how to test my views and templates using Django's test client to ensure they work as expected. This chapter provided essential skills for building efficient and maintainable Django applications.
